    <h2>Electric Types</h2>

    <p>There are relatively few Electric Pokémon; in fact only four were added in the third generation. Most are based on rodents or inanimate objects.</p>

    <p>Electric Pokémon are very good defensively, being weak only to Ground moves. Eelektross is the only Pokémon to have no type disadvantages due to its ability, Levitate.</p>
